# ADR 0004 — Onboarding Wizard Invariants

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2026-04-26
- **Deciders:** Saaqib (founder)
- **Supersedes:** N/A — establishes the onboarding architecture for Phase 3
  and forward.

## Context

Phase 3 builds the onboarding wizard: a 6-step form that collects everything
the compatibility engine needs (housing, lifestyle, values, profile basics) and
populates the existing `Profile` and `Preferences` tables. The wizard is the
single most product-critical screen in the app — every downstream feature
(matching, listings, messaging) depends on the data it produces.

Six architecture decisions were flagged for explicit sign-off before any code
was written. The founder weighed in on each (with a prompt-side reviewer pass
on Q2). This ADR codifies the resulting invariants in one document so a future
engineer (or a future me) can find them all at once.

The invariants below are **load-bearing**. Each was chosen with explicit
trade-offs over plausible alternatives. Don't relax any of them without
re-reading this ADR end to end and updating it.

## Decisions (the 8 invariants)

### 1. Admin/Moderator/Support roles are preserved through onboarding

The wizard's "intent" question writes to two places:

- `OnboardingState.intent: String?` — the UX label (`"seeker" | "lister" | "both"`),
  used for resume pre-fill and analytics.
- `User.roles: Role[]` — the canonical permission source the rest of the
  system reads.

The mapping is fixed:

```typescript
function intentToRoles(intent: 'seeker' | 'lister' | 'both'): Role[] {
  switch (intent) {
    case 'seeker': return ['SEEKER'];
    case 'lister': return ['LISTER'];
    case 'both':   return ['SEEKER', 'LISTER'];
  }
}
```

When the step-1 server action writes `User.roles`, it MUST preserve any
admin-tier role the user already holds. The implementation is:

```typescript
const adminRoles = existingUser.roles.filter(
  (r) => r === 'MODERATOR' || r === 'ADMIN' || r === 'SUPPORT',
);
const intentRoles = intentToRoles(input.intent);
const newRoles = Array.from(new Set([...adminRoles, ...intentRoles]));
```

**Invariant:** `MODERATOR`, `ADMIN`, and `SUPPORT` roles, once granted, are
never removed by onboarding — even if the user re-runs step 1 with a
different intent. Onboarding owns `SEEKER` and `LISTER`. It does not own the
admin tier.

**Why dual-write at all** (rather than deriving the label from `User.roles`):
the roles array may legitimately contain non-onboarding entries (a moderator
who's also a seeker), so re-deriving "what intent did they pick?" from the
array requires assumptions about which roles are "intent roles." Storing the
label separately removes that fragility.

### 2. Partial onboarding state lives in `OnboardingState.draftData`; `Preferences` rows only exist for users with complete prefs

Steps 3, 4, and 5 of the wizard collectively populate the `Preferences` row.
But the schema requires `budgetMin`, `budgetMax`, `moveInDate`, `cleanliness`,
`schedule`, and `preferredCities` — fields that span multiple steps. Three
options were considered:

- (a) Make those fields nullable. **Rejected** — every read-site forever has
  to handle nulls for fields that are conceptually required for a complete
  profile.
- (c) Insert a `Preferences` row at step 3 with placeholder defaults
  (`cleanliness=AVERAGE`, `schedule=FLEXIBLE`); overwrite at step 4.
  **Rejected** by the founder after the prompt-side review pass, on the
  grounds that placeholder defaults pollute downstream reads if anyone
  forgets to gate on `completedAt`.
- (b) Stash partial data in `OnboardingState.draftData: Json` until enough is
  collected to construct a complete `Preferences` row, then promote in one
  transaction. **Selected.**

**Invariant:** A `Preferences` row exists if and only if the user has
collected enough data to populate every required column. While onboarding is
in flight for steps 3–5, the partial data lives in
`OnboardingState.draftData` (a JSON object), not `Preferences`.

**Promotion rule.** At every step-3, step-4, and step-5 server action, after
merging the new step's data into `draftData`:

1. Check `isDraftPromotable(draft)` (see `src/lib/onboarding/draft-schema.ts`).
2. If true, run a `prisma.$transaction` that:
   - `prisma.preferences.upsert({ where: { userId }, create: full row, update: full row })`
   - `prisma.onboardingState.update({ where: { userId }, data: { draftData: {} } })`
3. If false, the draft stays in `OnboardingState.draftData` until the next step.

`isDraftPromotable` returns `true` when all of the following are present in
the draft: `budgetMin`, `budgetMax`, `moveInDate`, `cleanliness`, `schedule`,
and `preferredCities` (length ≥ 1). Optional `Preferences` fields (faith,
dietary practice, dealbreakers, etc.) ride into the row from whatever the
draft contains at the moment of promotion; absent fields take the
schema-level defaults.

**Reads.** The form pre-fill on resume goes through a single helper,
`getOnboardingFormData(userId)`, which returns a unified shape regardless of
whether the data lives in `Preferences` or `draftData`. The merge precedence
is `Preferences` over `draftData` (i.e. once a row is promoted, it wins).
**No UI code branches on storage location.** This is the cardinal rule of
this invariant — the storage split is invisible above the service layer.

**Idempotency.** Writing the same step twice is safe at every layer:
- `draftData` writes are key-overwrite JSON merges.
- The promotion uses `upsert`.
- After promotion, subsequent step-3/4/5 writes go *through* the promotion
  flow again — the draft contains the new field, the existing `Preferences`
  row gets `update`d with the same values plus the new override, draft is
  re-cleared.

### 3. Wizard versioning policy

`OnboardingState.version: Int @default(1)` is the wizard's structural
version. It's bumped (in the file `src/lib/onboarding/version.ts`) whenever
the wizard's step structure changes:

- Steps added, removed, or reordered.
- The semantic meaning of a `currentStep` value changes (e.g. step 3 used to
  be "Housing" but now means "Verification").
- The shape of `draftData` changes incompatibly.

**Invariant:** All new `OnboardingState` rows write
`version: CURRENT_ONBOARDING_VERSION`. No code path uses a hard-coded `1`.

When the version is bumped, existing rows from earlier versions must be
migrated explicitly via a one-shot migration script. The migration must
re-interpret `currentStep`, `completedSteps`, and `draftData` under the new
schema. There is no auto-migration based on `version` field comparison.

This invariant costs us one extra column (4 bytes/row, negligible). It buys
us the ability to evolve the wizard without breaking users who are
mid-flow.

### 4. Vocabulary is enforced at the application layer; future migration to Postgres enums deferred

Several `Preferences` columns are typed `String` with no DB-level enum
constraint:

- `drinkingSelf`, `drinkingRoommate`, `petsRoommate`, `guests`,
  `noiseTolerance`, `cookingFrequency`, `dietaryPractice`.

These cannot be enforced by Postgres today (the schema is `String`).
Application-level enforcement lives in `src/lib/onboarding/vocabulary.ts`,
which exports two things per field:

1. A `const` array of `{ value, label }` objects (UI imports the labels for
   dropdowns).
2. A Zod enum derived from the array (server validators import this).

**Invariant:** Both UI and server use the SAME constants. There are no other
sources of truth for these values anywhere in the codebase. Adding a new
value requires editing `vocabulary.ts` and is the only legitimate way to
introduce one.

**Locked vocabularies** (final, after prompt-side review):

| Field              | Values                                                                                              |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `drinkingSelf`     | `never`, `rarely`, `socially`, `regularly`                                                          |
| `drinkingRoommate` | `none`, `rarely`, `socially`, `any` (symmetric — no `_ok` suffix)                                   |
| `petsRoommate`     | `none`, `cats_ok`, `dogs_ok`, `small_only`, `any`                                                   |
| `guests`           | `rarely`, `sometimes`, `often`                                                                      |
| `noiseTolerance`   | `quiet`, `moderate`, `lively`                                                                       |
| `cookingFrequency` | `rarely`, `sometimes`, `often`, `daily`                                                             |
| `dietaryPractice`  | `none`, `vegetarian`, `vegan`, `pescatarian`, `halal_personal`, `halal_kitchen`, `kosher_personal`, `kosher_kitchen`, `other` |

**Migration to native Postgres enums** is explicitly deferred to Phase 5 or
later. Once the vocabulary has stabilized in production we may convert these
columns to enum types via `ALTER TYPE` migrations. Doing it now would lock
in values we haven't validated with users.

### 5. Photo upload deferred to Phase 4

Phase 3 step 6 does not collect a profile photo. The step renders a
non-input placeholder card with verbatim copy:

> "You can finish onboarding without a photo. Add one anytime from
> Settings → Profile."

`Profile.photoUrl` remains `null` for all Phase 3 users. Every photo-display
site (dashboard avatar, profile card, listing avatar) must render an
**initials avatar fallback** when `photoUrl` is null. Phase 3 wires this
fallback through the dashboard avatar component so that Phase 4's S3 upload
work is purely "populate `photoUrl` and the UI lights up automatically."

**Invariant:** No code path in Phase 3 writes to `Profile.photoUrl`. No code
path crashes when `photoUrl` is null. The fallback is a single component
shared by every avatar render site.

Rationale: every option that accepted a Phase-3 photo URL would need
validation, mixed-content handling, hotlink rules, and would generate data
we'd just have to migrate or invalidate in Phase 4 when the real upload
flow lands. The cost of the deferral is one Phase-3 user trade-off (initials
instead of photo on the dashboard); the cost of the alternative is real bug
surface and user-visible churn during the Phase 4 transition.

### 6. Dealbreakers are a typed Zod discriminated union

`Preferences.dealbreakers` is declared as `Json @default("[]")` in the
schema. The Phase 3 wizard step 5 writes a typed shape into it:

```typescript
const dealbreakerSchema = z.discriminatedUnion('kind', [
  z.object({ kind: z.literal('no_smoking') }),
  z.object({ kind: z.literal('no_pets') }),
  z.object({ kind: z.literal('gender'), value: z.enum(['male_only', 'female_only']) }),
  z.object({ kind: z.literal('faith_match') }),
  z.object({ kind: z.literal('no_drinking') }),
  z.object({ kind: z.literal('budget_max'), value: z.number().positive() }),
]);
```

The array is capped at 10 entries (`dealbreakersSchema = z.array(dealbreakerSchema).max(10)`).

**Invariant:** All writes to `dealbreakers` must validate through
`dealbreakersSchema`. All reads (Phase 5 matching engine, profile display,
admin tooling) must import and parse via the same schema. Adding a new
dealbreaker `kind` is a single edit to the union — and forces every reader
to handle it (TypeScript exhaustiveness).

This is the only typed contract we have over a `Json` column today. The
contract is enforced in code, not in the database. If we ever discover a row
with a non-conforming shape (e.g. legacy data, manual SQL edit), the
matching engine should drop the malformed dealbreaker (and log it) rather
than crash.

### 7. DOB is stored as UTC midnight; age computation is canonical

`Profile.dateOfBirth: DateTime` is required. Users enter a date via an HTML
`<input type="date">` which yields a `YYYY-MM-DD` string with no timezone
component.

**Invariant:** The DOB string is converted to a `Date` representing **UTC
midnight on the user's entered calendar date** before storage. The conversion
helper `dobToStoredDate` lives in `src/lib/dates.ts` and is the only place
DOB strings get parsed. The time component of the stored value is never
read; only the date.

**Age** is computed by `ageFromDob(dob, now = new Date())` from the same
file, using the average year length 365.2425 days. This deliberately avoids
calendar-arithmetic gotchas (leap years, DST) at the cost of being correct
to within ~6 hours of the true birthday — fine for our use cases (≥18 gate,
matching age band).

No other DOB math is permitted anywhere. If a feature needs age, it imports
`ageFromDob`. If a feature needs the birth calendar date, it reads the
stored `DateTime` directly (the UTC midnight representation makes the
calendar date stable).

### 8. Identity verifications are post-onboarding only

The `VerificationRecord` model exists in the schema (Phase 6 owns its
implementation). No verification flow may be entered until the user's
`OnboardingState.completedAt IS NOT NULL`.

**Invariant:** All Phase-6 verification entry points (route handlers, server
actions, UI links) MUST gate on `completedAt`. Users mid-onboarding cannot
start a verification.

This is a forward-looking ADR entry — there is no Phase-3 code change to
make today. It exists here because the data model already permits the
collision (a user could in principle have a `VerificationRecord` row with no
`OnboardingState`), and locking the invariant now is cheaper than fixing it
later.

## Cross-cutting consequences

### The matching engine (Phase 5) gates on `OnboardingState.completedAt`

Together, invariants 1, 2, 4, 6, and 7 imply a hard rule for Phase 5:
**the matching engine must consider only users with
`OnboardingState.completedAt IS NOT NULL`.** Reasoning:

- Invariant 2: `Preferences` may not exist yet for in-progress users.
  Reading `Preferences` for them returns nothing; matching cannot proceed.
- Invariant 4: vocabulary values are application-enforced. A pre-onboarding
  row could in principle have unknown strings (it can't today, but the rule
  guards against drift).
- Invariant 6: dealbreaker shapes are typed. Pre-promotion drafts contain
  unvalidated arrays.
- Invariant 7: age computation needs a stored DOB. Pre-step-2 users have no
  Profile row.

### The proxy gates feature routes on `hl_onboarded`

A separate cookie `hl_onboarded=1` is set when `completedAt` becomes
non-null, and cleared on logout. The Edge proxy reads this cookie (Edge
can't reach Prisma) to redirect un-onboarded authed users to `/onboarding`.
This is described in detail in the Phase 3 mega-prompt; the invariant here
is that the cookie's truth value mirrors `completedAt`.

### Service layer is the ONLY mutator of onboarding state

All writes to `User.roles`, `Profile`, `Preferences`, and `OnboardingState`
during Phase 3 happen through `src/server/services/onboarding.ts`. No route
handler, no Server Component, no client form bypasses it. This is the
boundary at which invariants 1–8 are enforced.

### Resume UX is invariant-blind

Because `getOnboardingFormData(userId)` merges `Preferences` and `draftData`
behind a single shape, every step form takes the same `initialValues` prop
regardless of whether it's a first-time fill, a mid-flow resume, or an
edit-from-settings. This shields the UI from the persistence model.

## Verification

Each invariant has a corresponding test or check. The verification block in
the Task 7 end-to-end report must demonstrate each:

| Invariant | Verification |
| --------- | ------------ |
| 1 (admin roles preserved) | V4 — manually grant a test user `MODERATOR` via direct DB write, run them through onboarding picking `seeker`, assert `roles` array still contains `MODERATOR` after step 1 save. |
| 2 (draftData → Preferences promotion) | V6 — SQL inspection at three points: after step 3 (Preferences absent, draftData populated), after step 4 (Preferences present, draftData empty), after step 5 (Preferences updated, draftData empty). |
| 3 (`CURRENT_ONBOARDING_VERSION`) | Static check — `rg "version: 1" src/server src/lib/onboarding` should return zero matches; `rg "CURRENT_ONBOARDING_VERSION" src` should return matches in service, schema-emit code, and the helper. |
| 4 (vocabulary lock) | Type check — Zod parsing rejects unknown values in V4 negative cases. UI dropdown values come from the same module. |
| 5 (photo deferred) | Static check — `rg "photoUrl" src/features/onboarding` should return zero non-comment matches. Dashboard renders initials when `photoUrl` is null (visual check in V1). |
| 6 (typed dealbreakers) | V4 — Zod refinement rejects malformed dealbreaker shapes; matching engine import in Phase 5 will use the same module. |
| 7 (DOB as UTC midnight) | Unit-level check — submitting `2000-01-01` from a non-UTC client and reading back the stored `dateOfBirth` returns ISO `2000-01-01T00:00:00.000Z`. |
| 8 (verifications post-onboarding) | Phase-6 deliverable — no Phase-3 code change. ADR entry only. |

## Revisiting this ADR

This ADR is the contract for Phase 3 onboarding. Don't supersede it
casually. Specifically:

- **Adding a vocabulary value** is editing the table in §4 and shipping a
  migration plan if it's a backfill. Not a supersede.
- **Bumping `CURRENT_ONBOARDING_VERSION`** writes a follow-up ADR (0005+)
  describing the structural change and the migration script for existing
  rows. This ADR remains valid for v1.
- **Promoting a `dealbreaker` `kind`** is a code edit; the ADR's union list
  is illustrative — the canonical list is the Zod schema in code.
- **Changing the option-(b) draft model** (e.g. moving partial state to
  Redis, splitting the draft per-step) is a supersede that requires a new
  ADR and a data migration plan for in-flight users.
